# Inventory Firmware Settings with ConfigMgr

This .MOF file for System Center Configuration Manager will inventory the most common/relevent firmware settings from Dell, HP, and Lenovo.

Note:  Dell hardware still requires you to deploy an additional piece of software to expose the firmware settings to WMI (Dell Command | Monitor, formerly Dell OMCI). HP stopped requiring this back in about 2012. Lenovo stopped requiring it before then.  Someday, Dell... Someday!
(If you want Dell to change this, please feel free to harrass @WarrenByle, their systems management guy. He already knows/agrees, but the more customer feedback he gets, the easier it is to get the change made.)
